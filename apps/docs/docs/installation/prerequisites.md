# Prerequisites

Scholarsome is open source software, and we support user installations.

Docker is the only prerequisite for a standard installation.

Before starting installation, be sure that it is installed on the system that you will be running Scholarsome within. Docker installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

# Creating Folders

Folders are compromised of sets and other folders. They are used to help organize sets into discrete subdivisions.

To create a folder, click the purple button in the navigation bar that says "Create", and then click "Folder." This will take you to the creation page.

At the top of the page, you're able to set the name of the folder, the description, the color, and the visibility.

Below this section, you can configure the parent folder and subfolders.

At the bottom of the page, you can configure which sets should be within this folder. Sets can be in many folders at the same time.

Click the purple "Create" button on the page once you are finished. After creating a folder, it can be edited by clicking the "Edit" button in the top right of the folder's page.

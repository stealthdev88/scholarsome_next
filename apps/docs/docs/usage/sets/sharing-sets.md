# Sharing Sets

Sets can have either a private or public visibility in Scholarsome. Unless the "private" check box is ticked while creating a set, sets are public. This can be changed at anytime by editing a set.

When a set is private, the set cannot be accessed by anyone else. The creator of the set is the only one who can view the set, use flashcards, and create quizzes.

When a set is public, the URL/link of a set can be accessed by anyone. Other users can view the set, use flashcards, and create quizzes. The only action other users cannot do is edit the set.

To share a set with others, simply copy the URL/link of the set and share it with the users you would like to be able to access the set. Alternatively, the "share" button can be clicked on the set page, and the URL/link can be copied there.

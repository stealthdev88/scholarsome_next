# Creating Sets

Sets are the core foundation of Scholarsome. Flashcards, quizzes, and all other study features are built on top of the data stored within sets.

## Creating a Set

The most common way to create a set is manually, where each card is typed in.

To create a set manually, click the purple button in the navigation bar that says "Create", and then click "Study set." This will take you to the set creation page.

In this menu, you can configure the set's title, description, visibility, and add cards. Your progress will be saved in your browser while creating a set - even if you close the tab, close your browser, or even restart your device. Click the purple "Create" button on the page once you are finished configuring the set. After creating a set, all parts of it can still be edited.

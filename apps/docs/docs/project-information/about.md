## Security Reports

Scholarsome is free and open-source software. We encourage browsing the codebase and hunt for security issues. If you come across a potential security issue that concerns you, please do not hesitate to report any issues to `support@scholarsome.com`. We ask that you **do not** use the repository's issues page to report bugs that involve major security issues.

## Inquiries and Getting Support

For formal inquiries that involve issues only with the **public website** or questions about the project as a whole, you email us at `support@scholarsome.com`.

Otherwise, we recommend joining our Discord server. Community support is offered here, and being in the server allows you to keep up-to-date with future versions and upcoming features.

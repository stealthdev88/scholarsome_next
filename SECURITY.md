## Reporting a vulnerability

Reach out to the <a href="https://github.com/hwgilbert16">project lead</a> directly when reporting a vulnerability. __Do not__ use public facing areas, such as GitHub issues, to report security vunerabilities.

Additionally, you can email support@scholarsome to report security issues.

A public security advisory will be created once a patch for the issue is available.
